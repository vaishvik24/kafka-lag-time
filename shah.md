Once weâ€™ve built up an interpolation table of at least two values we can begin estimating time lag by performing the following operations (some edge cases are omitted for clarity) for each last consumed offset of each partition. Lookup interpolation table for a consumer group partition Find two points within the table that contain the last consumed offset If there are no two points that contain the last consumed offset then use the first and last points as input to the interpolation formula. This is the extrapolation use case. Interpolate inside (or extrapolate outside) the two points from the table we picked to predict a timestamp for when the last consumed message was first produced. Take the difference of the time of the last consumed offset (~ the current time) and the predicted timestamp to find the time lag.
